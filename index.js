 * ### Challenge `processFirstItem`
 * 
 * @instructions
 * Implement a higher-order function called `processFirstItem`.
 * It takes two arguments:
 * @param stringList an array of strings.
 * @param callback function that takes a string as its argument.
 * @returns the result of invoking `callback` with the FIRST element in `stringList`.
 * 
 * Example of usage of this higher-order function:
 * Invoking `processFirstItem` passing `['foo', 'bar']` and `(str) => str + str`,
 * should return 'foofoo'.

/* Task 1: `counterMaker`
 * Study the code for counter1 and counter2. Answer the questions below.
 * 
 * 1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
 * counter 1 returns a function, and all the works is done under the same function. Besides that, counter1 creates a variable only available for that function while counter 2 makes a variable for the whole code. 
 * 2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
 * Counter1, besides having 2 functions, it creates a variable only for that block of code. 
 * 3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would counter2 be better? 
 *When you don't wan't to create a variable that will be used in multiple places in your code, you want to use counter1 as it does not affect the rest of the code.
